## Inspiration
After having many older friends who left for college, I often got updates on their college lives from their parents. Many of them had stressful and nervous lives, despite going to the college of their dreams. They reported not being able to have the proper tools and locations to further their college lives and having to juggle mental and financial problems as well. 

## What it does
College Aid is an Android app that allows college students and educators to find what they need. College students can find courses, internships/jobs, scholarship opportunities, and even a student loan interest calculator. For emotional help, students can call the default US emotional help hotline or view scientific articles that reference valuable coping methods. On the other hand, educators and recruiters can add these courses, career opportunities, and scholarships. Both sides are now able to benefit thanks to College Aid. 

## How we built it
We built the frontend using Flutter, Firebase Auth for Authentication, Firestore for the NoSQL database, and various dart packages to help build our app. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into Flutter dependency and version issues. We were able to solve this by updating our flutter SDK. this ran into a couple other errors but we solved them by changing our Kotlin version. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to build such an amazing app with great looking UI and many different functionalities in such a short amount of time. 

## What we learned
We learned about web URLs in mobile development and what we had to do in order to send email, texts, and more directly through the app. 

## What's next for College-Aid
We plan to look for more problems college students may be facing and integrate them into our app.
